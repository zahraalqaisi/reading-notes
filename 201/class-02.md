# Chapter 2: “Text” 
## text:

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# Chapter 10: Ch.10 Introducing CSS:

### CSS Associates Style 
rules with HTML 
elements

***CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern 
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule 
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.***

### CSS Properties Affect 
How Elements Are 
Displayed

***CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two 
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify 
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.***

##Summary
INTRODUCING CSS:

-  CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.
-  Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” 

**how to declare variables?**

*before we use variables we need to announce that we want to use it . this involes creating the variable and giving it a name*

***how to assign variables to a value?***

*once we have created a var. we can tell it what information we would like it to store for us pregrammers say that we assign a value to the var.*

## summary "basic javascript instructions"

- a script is made up of a series of statements. each statement is like a step in a recipe

-Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in  the script.

- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

- Expressions evaluate into a single value.

- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 


## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” 
> only up to the section on switch statements 

### A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

> he variable named 1 eve l is the switch value. If the value of the l eve 1 variable is the string One, then the code for the first case is executed. If it is Two, the second case is executed. If it is Three, the third case is executed. If it is none of these, the code for the defaul t  case is executed. The entire statement lives in one code block (set of curly braces), and a colon separates the option from the statements that are to be run if the case matches the switch value. At the end of each case is the break keyword. It tells the JavaScript interpreter that it has finished with this switch statement and to proceed to run any subsequent code that appears after it.
