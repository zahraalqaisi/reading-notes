# Functions:

## what is Functions?

 it is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

 ##  Function Syntax:

 A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

 ### function names contain
 -  letters
 - digit
 - underscores
 - and dollar signs

 > Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

 > Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

 > Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

 ## Function Invocation:

 
Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)


## Function Return:

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

## why we use function?
- we can reuse the same code many times

- Functions Used as Variable Values

- Local Variables
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
