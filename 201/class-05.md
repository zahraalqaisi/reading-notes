## Chapter 5: “Images”

### why need to add an image to a web page?

> because we might want to include 
> - a logo
> - photograph

> - chart

> because A picture can say a thousand words, and great 
images help make the difference between an 
average-looking site and a really engaging one.


**Storing Images on Your Site**

> if you are building a site from scratch, it is good 
practice to create a folder for all of the images 
the site uses

**Adding Images**
> img src="link" alt="a name of the img" />

 > we can add other attributes such as :
 - title 
 - width
 - hight 
 - align


***There are three rules to remember when you 
are creating images for your website***

1. Save images in the right format


2. Save images at the right size


3. Use the correct resolution

### summary "img"

- The <img> element is used to add images to a 
  web page.
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the 
 source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the 
 content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using 
 them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
  Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or 
 logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.


## Chapter 11: “Color”

***Understanding Color***

> Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, 
 green, and blue(r,g,b). To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

 ### CSS3: HSL Colors

***CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive 
way to specify colors using***
- hue 
- saturation, 
- lightness values.


### summary color: 

- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps 
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: 
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast 
between any text and the background color (otherwise 
people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to 
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, 
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA


## Chapter 12: “Text”

### Typeface Terminology: 

- Serif 
- Sans-Serif
- Monospace
- Weight
- Style
- Stretch

### Units of Type Size:

- Pixels : for exampte (h1  24px)
- Percentages: for exampte (h1 200%)
- Ems: for exampte(h1 1.5em)


### summary "text"

 - There are properties to control the choice of font, size, 
weight, style, and spacing.
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume 
most people will have installed.
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are 
several options, but you need to have the right license 
to use them.
- You can control the space between lines of text, 
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned 
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be 
indented.
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an 
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or 
when they have visited a link.
