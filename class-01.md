# Introduction :

## How People Access the Web?

- Browsers

- Web Servers

- Screen readers

- Devices

## How Websites Are Created?

** All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix ** 

## How the Web Works?

** When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server. **

# Structure: 

** HTML Uses Elements
to Describe the
Structure of Pages **

*** about elements *** 

> Attributes Tell Us
More About Elements

> Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.




- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
-  They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation) 

### Summary LISTS:

- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.


### Writing Links

***Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute. ***


### Summary links :

- Links are created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

### Summary images :

- The <img> element is used to add images to a
web page.
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
