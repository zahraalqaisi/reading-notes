> Chapter 3: “Lists”

## about lists:
- There are three types of HTML lists:
  - ordered : use numbers.
  - unordered : use bullets.
  - definition : used to define terminology.
    Lists can be nested inside one another.

> Chapter 13: “Boxes”

    ## about boxes:
   ***Every box has three available properties that 
 can be adjusted to control its appearance:***

 - Border:
  > Every box has a border (even if 
 it is not visible or is specified to 
 be 0 pixels wide). The border 
 separates the edge of one box 
 from another.

 - Margin:
  > Margins sit outside the edge 
 of the border. You can set the 
 width of a margin to create a 
 gap between the borders of two 
 adjacent boxes.

 - Padding:
  > Padding is the space between 
 the border of a box and any 
 content contained within it. 
 Adding padding can increase the 
 readability of its contents.

 ### White space &
Vertical Margin

***The padding and 
margin properties 
are very helpful 
in adding space 
between various 
items on the page***


# JS book:

>  Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions”

**how to declare variables?**

*before we use variables we need to announce that we want to use it . this involes creating the variable and giving it a name*

***how to assign variables to a value?***

*once we have created a var. we can tell it what information we would like it to store for us pregrammers say that we assign a value to the var.*

## summary "basic javascript instructions"

- a script is made up of a series of statements. each statement is like a step in a recipe

-Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in  the script.

- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

- Expressions evaluate into a single value.

- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 


## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” 
> only up to the section on switch statements 

### A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

> he variable named 1 eve l is the switch value. If the value of the l eve 1 variable is the string One, then the code for the first case is executed. If it is Two, the second case is executed. If it is Three, the third case is executed. If it is none of these, the code for the defaul t  case is executed. The entire statement lives in one code block (set of curly braces), and a colon separates the option from the statements that are to be run if the case matches the switch value. At the end of each case is the break keyword. It tells the JavaScript interpreter that it has finished with this switch statement and to proceed to run any subsequent code that appears after it. 


### loops:

> the loop check the condition it it returs true a code block will run then the condition will be checked againit repeats untill the condition returns false 

***there are 3 comman types of loops:***

- for loop.
- while loop.
- do while loop.

*** the condition is made up of 3 statements:***
- initialization: var i= 0;
- condition: i>10;
- update : i++
