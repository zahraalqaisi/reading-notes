### creating an object constructor notation

***the new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object you can then add properties and methods to the object ***

### updating the object :

***to update the value of properties use dot notation or square brecket they work on objects created using litaral or constructor notation
to delete a propety use the delete keuword***


### CREATING MANY OBJECTS: CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION 

***Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. First, create the template with the object's properties and methods***

### arrays are object 

***they hold a related set of key/value pairs (like all objects) but the key for each value is its an index number***


### arrays of object and object in arrays :

*** you can combine arrays and object to create complex data sutrcture arrays can store a series of object and object can also hold arrays
