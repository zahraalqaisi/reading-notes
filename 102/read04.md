# Expressions and operators

## Operators:

- Assignment operators:

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand

- Comparison operator:

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true

- Arithmetic operators:

An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+) (-) (*) (/)  (%)

- Bitwise operators:

A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers

- Logical operators:

Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However,

- String operators:

In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.

- Conditional (ternary) operator:

 the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition

- Comma operator:

 (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. This operator is primarily used inside a for loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the loop. It is regarded bad style to use it elsewhere, when it is not necessary. Often two separate statements can and should be used instead.

- Unary operators:
it  is an operation with only one operand.

- Relational operators:

compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.

# Expressions:

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value

## expression categories:

- Arithmetic: evaluates to a number

- String: evaluates to a character string

- Logical: evaluates to true or false

- Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions

- Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.


# contol flow:

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
